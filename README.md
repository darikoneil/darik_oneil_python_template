# Python Development Template Repository
Simply a template repository for development in python. While it contains a pyproject.toml, this template is not restricted to use in the development of python packages. You can perform an 'editable install' of your local code to leverage the benefits in a more transient scripting or analysis environment.

```
python -m pip install -e .[all]
```
